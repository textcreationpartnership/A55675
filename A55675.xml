            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Had really a kindneſs for you, becauſe I had good hopes of you, that you might become a good Man, if it pleaſed God to prolong your Life; and therefore have done already what I can for you, and ſhall be ready to do more, if it pleaſe God to give any opportunity. But becauſe I find your Caſe very dangerous in that reſpect, conſidering what hath been ſworn againſt you, and that this is not the firſt Fault, and there being great Complaints to the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the frequent Crimes that are committed of that kind; inſomuch that the Judge, who is a very good Man, and as tender of the Life of a Man, as is conſiſtent with his Duty, cannot ſhew you that Favour that otherwiſe he would, the greateſt Kindneſs that I can do you, is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you how to improve your preſent Circumſtances, which if you accordingly do, it will be ten thouſand times better than Life it ſelf. You muſt therefore know that <hi>the Great Buſineſs and End of our mortal Life</hi> in the Fleſh is to work the Creature by various Exerciſes to an entire Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Great, Glorious, and moſt Excellent Creator; who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41069:2"/>is the Father of Spirits, and hath not only a juſt and abſolute Right and Dominion over us by Creation, Suſtentation and Redemption, but is in himſelf of ſo tranſcendent Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo unconceivably Good and Gracious to his poor deſpicable Creatures (whereof the Love of Parents to their Children is but a little Repreſentation) that even Prudence and Gratitude, if it was well conſidered, would effectually prevail with a Man of Senſe to ſeek his Favour, though by the moſt Abſolute Subjection that can be conceived, were we not obliged to it by his Abſolute Dominion, and ſubject to his Irreſiſtable Power. And ſo that this entire Subjection be but effectually wrought in us, it matters not whether our Life be long or ſhort: Be it never ſo ſhort, if the Work be but perfectly done, it is the ſame thing as if it was longer; nay, in ſome reſpects better; for then it is ſecure; whereas till then it is in danger; only we are in the Hands of a Faithful Creator, and have continual Occaſion of Exerciſe of our Dependance upon him. Now to come to <hi>your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſe:</hi> It ſeeems you have ran a Courſe directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; inſtead of exerciſing your ſelf to this Subjection, you perhaps have never in your Life been ſenſible of any ſuch Work you had to do; and not only not done any thing toward it, but done the quite contrary; inſtead of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting your Senſual Appetites to your Reaſon (which is the firſt part of this Exerciſe, and what all Mankind muſt account for) you have ſubjected the Man to the Beaſt in you, and abuſed your natural Faculties and Powers to ſerve and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your Animal Affections; and inſtead of ſubjecting your Will to the Holy and Righteous External Declarations of the Will of God; you have yielded to the ſecret Motions of the Apoſtate Spirits in your Animal Affections in Diſobedience and Rebellion againſt that Holy Will of God. And by this means inſtead of promoting the great Buſineſs of your Life, you have run your ſelf into a worſe condition than when you were born and firſt began to live; ſo that thus much of your Life is not only loſt, but miſ-ſpent to your own Damage. And now to recover all again, and perfect this great Work, for which you had a longer Life aſſign'd you, in ſo ſhort a time as is now allowed you, you may think very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41069:2"/>hard, if not impoſſible. But be of good comfort: Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath much more abounded. God is able to do greater matters than this, if he be graciouſly ſo pleaſed, in leſs time; but then you muſt ſeek to him, and do what you can to prepare your ſelf for his Grace, and to be ready to cooperate with it faithfully. To this end you muſt endeavour to baniſh all thoughts of this World, and even of your Temporal Life it ſelf, and enter into ſerious Conſideration of the Great and Glorious Majeſty of God, who by his Wiſdom and Power hath Created and Governs the whole Univerſe, whereof the whole Earth in reſpect of the reſt is but as a drop of a Bucket, and in reſpect of him as nothing; and then conſider with your ſelf, what a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable thing you are in compariſon of the Earth and all its Inhabitants, which yet altogether is ſo little as I have ſaid in reſpect of Almighty God; ſo deſpicable, if you were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and righteous; and therefore that you ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated as to dare to tranſgreſs the leaſt of his Commands, doth juſtly deſerve not only Temporal Death, and to be cut off from the Children of Men, to whom you have been an Enemy, and Confederated with the Enemies of their Peace and Quiet, but Eternal Damnation, and to be for ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Glorious Preſence, againſt whom you have rebelled, and to have your part with thoſe Apoſtate Spirits, whoſe Motions you have obeyed, in eternal Miſery. And never ceaſe muſing and conſidering theſe great and plain Truths, and lifting up your Heart to God with fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Prayers, that he will condeſcend to give you Grace, to enlighten your Mind, and mollifie your Heart with a deep Senſe of your miſerable Condition, till you find your ſelf ſo affected and concerned for the Favour of God and the Salvation of your Soul, that all Concern and Thought for your Temporal Life, as an inconſiderable thing in reſpect of that, may wholly ceaſe; and that your Soul be mightily humbled with a deep Senſe of your utter unworthineſs, that that Great and Glorious and moſt Holy Majeſty ſhould have any regard to ſo deſpicable and ſo ſinful a Wretch, with great Indignation againſt your Sin and Madneſs, and againſt thoſe curſed Apoſtate Spirits, which by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41069:3"/>Impreſſions have preſſed you on into all this Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Miſchief. When you have gotten thus far, thoſe wicked Spirits, when they find they can no longer keep you in Darkneſs and Impenitence, will ſtrive to thruſt you head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into Deſpair, and poſſeſs you with dreadful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Holineſs, Juſtice, and Severity of God. And therefore you muſt further know, that this Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty, though moſt Holy, Righteous and Terrible to the Impenitent and Incorrigible, yet is of unconceivable Mercy, Clemency and Goodneſs to truly humble and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners: And though he be a God of ſuch Holineſs and Purity that there is no immediate Acceſs to him for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable and polluted Creatures as the Children of Men, yet hath he in his great Mercy and Wiſdom provided a moſt admirable Expedient, whereby we may have acceſs to him at all times with Confidence and Aſſurance of Acceptance; and not only Pardon of Sin, but Grace alſo, and Divine Power to ſerve him acceptably. And this is by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, God and Man united in one Perſon, who having run the ſame Race and Exerciſe of Subjection by Obedience even to Death, and the moſt ſhameful Death, the Death of the Croſs, and thereby obtained Favour for us with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, him hath God exalted to be Judge both of Quick and Dead, and to be a Prince and a Saviour to all that obey him, and are united to him by his Spirit reſiding and ruling in their Hearts. Him hath God propoſed to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us by his Paſſion and Death, and raiſed up to be a Mediator and an Advocate for us with him in Heaven; and by him, and in his Name, all who are Seal'd with, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Spirit, have Acceſs and certain Acceptance with the Father. But that you may be one of theſe, here is again, as before, ſomething to be done by you. You muſt ruminate much upon the admirable Clemency and Goodneſs of God to his poor Creatures, for the recovery of them out of a moſt miſerable Slavery to the Powers of Darkneſs; and how admirable a Perſon this Chriſt Jeſus is, who having performed a perfect Obedience to the Father in our Nature, and by his Paſſion conſecrated it, and exalted it to Heaven to be there as a Magnet to attract all who receive him, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41069:3"/>give up themſelves to obey him: And how great a new Obligation this is upon us to do ſo: How great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Benefit and Advantage is to our ſelves: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how much common Prudence and Gratitude ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you for that purpoſe. And never ceaſe muſing and thinking thereupon, and lifting up your. Heart to God in earneſt Deſires and Prayers in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus, and for his Sake, that he will be pleaſed to enlighten your Mind with a clear underſtanding of theſe admirable Truths, and fill your Heart with ſuch Love and Admiration of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo demonſtrated in this admirable Perſon, that all things in this World, your Temporal Life in the Fleſh, and all that you are or have, may appear to you, as in truth they are, very mean and deſpicable, and nothing valuable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable but Chriſt Jeſus, and an inſeparable Union with him; till you find your Heart ſo affected with theſe things, that you become intirely reſigned in all things to the Will of God, be willing and even deſirous to be Partaker of the Sufferings of that Holy and Innocent Perſon, which you have juſtly deſerved, and with full purpoſe of Heart give up your ſelf to an entire Subjection, Obedience and Service of the Holy Trinity, to whom you have been dedicated in your Baptiſm, to all Eternity. This is a great Work indeed; but God is able to do this, and more than we can ask or think, in leſs time than you have to prepare for it: And if he will be ſo gracious to you, you will be a happy Creature, and have reaſon to admire and bleſs his Holy Providence, and abundant Grace, which by ſo admirable Means hath brought you to it; and then you will have nothing more to do, but to perform ſome other Works of true Repentance, which I ſhall preſently ſhew you, and wait upon God and ſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for what-ever he ſhall call you to. Theſe remaining Works of Repentance reſpect either the particular Perſons you have wronged, or the State and your Country in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. To the particular Perſons you muſt make Reſtitution as far as you are able, pray to God to make up what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Grace and Bleſſing to them, and ſend to them and deſire their Pardon; and heartily forgive all who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured you, acknowledging them, what-ever they intended,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41069:4"/>to have been God's Inſtruments for your juſt Puniſhment and Correction, and pray heartily to God to pardon them. And to the State and your Country you muſt do what you can to make Satisfaction and Reſtitution by theſe means: You muſt do what you can to break thoſe wicked Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Confederations and Practices, by making all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery you can both of Robberies and ſuch like Practices, and of the Perſons who either uſe ſuch Practices, or harbor, or are any way Partners with them therein. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much I ſhall adviſe you, that you do it in Charity, not only to your Country, but even to the Malefactors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as that they may be reclaimed if poſſible; and therefore do it not to any one, but to ſuch as you think moſt like to uſe your Diſcoveries wiſely and charitably, with due care and reſpect even to them. And if you deſire my Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therein, I will endeavour to come to you on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, rather than you ſhall want Aſſiſtance. I have no more now but my Prayers for you to Almighty God, that he will bleſs theſe Inſtructions, make them effectual upon you, and by his powerful Grace perfect this great and good Work in your Soul.</p>

            <p>IT is a <hi>common Opinion among Malefactors,</hi> that it is a <hi>diſhonourable</hi> thing, and therefore odious and deteſtable, <hi>to diſcover,</hi> (which they call betraying) <hi>their Companions or Partners in their Crimes.</hi> But this is plainly a mere vulgar Error, and a groſs Miſtake, and no leſs pernicious to themſelves, and to their Partners, than to their Country, and Mankind in General. The <hi>Fallacy</hi> lies in the Miſapplication of a true Principle. For the true reaſon why Breach of Faith and Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truſt is ſo odious a thing among all Men, is, becauſe it is not only injurious to the Perſon, but tends to the diſturbance of Humane Society: So that if it was generelly practis'd, Men would not know how to deal one with another, and would be deprived of mutual Aſſiſtance in many caſes, and of one of the greateſt Comforts of Humane Life. But yet, as in many other Caſes, that which in the General is unlawful, diſhonourable and odious, (as the taking away the Life of a Man) may in a particular caſe, under ſome certain Circumſtances, become a neceſſary and commendable Duty, (as the Condemnation and Execution of a Murderer, which is an Act both of Juſtice upon the Malefactor, and of Charity to the reſt of Mankind, by preventing and diſcouraging other Murders) ſo it is in this: To
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41069:4"/>diſcover a Secret committed to ones Truſt, which may lawfully be concealed; but eſpecially, to do it for ones own advantage, and to the prejudice of his Confident, is commonly reputed, and very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a very baſe, unmanly, diſhoneſt and diſhonourable thing. But when the Secret or Confidence is in a thing wicked and unjuſt, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to other Perſons, and to the Society whereof a Man is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as, to his Country; this is no ſuch Secret as can honeſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; becauſe it is a Breach of Charity to the injured Perſons, and a Violation of that Faith, which, by an antecedent and greater Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is due to the whole Society, whereof he is a Member. Such mutual Confidences therefore are not properly Human Societies, but a kind of Confederacies of Enemies and Diſturbers of the proper Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Peace and Welfare of Men, tending to the Deſtruction thereof. And the Hypotheſis upon which they are built is for the ſame reaſon plainly a Deluſion, and probably a Stratagem of the Apoſtate Spirits and Enemies of Mankind, to ſtrengthen their Party and Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; ſo that as on the one hand this is no ſuch Truſt, as it is diſhonourable to any Perſon to break it, becauſe it is a wicked thing to engage in it; ſo on the other hand it is a Breach of Faith and Duty to the Society not to break but conceal it, and thereby ſupport a Confederacy of Enemies and Diſturbers of the Peace of his Country; ſo that the Perſon, who conceals what he knows of that nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes acceſſary, even after his Death, to all the Evils which are afterward committed, and might have been prevented by his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Beſides an obſtinate and wilful Concealment even to the Death, is not only a Confirmation of that particular wicked Confederacy wherein the Perſon is engaged, or any way concerned or acquainted, but tends mightily to harden others, and ſo to ſupport all ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Confederacies in general. Whereas did ſuch Perſons, at leaſt when apprehended, in their Affliction become ſerious, and not ſuffer themſelves to be longer abuſed and impoſed upon by ſuch a vulgar Error and Diabolical Deluſion, but conſider well, judge rightly, and act accordingly, ſuch wicked Confederacies could not ſubſiſt for want of mutual Confidence. Nor is ſuch Concealment only injurious to divers other particular Perſons, and a Violation of that Faith and Love, which all Men owe to their Country; but very pernicious, and of <hi>evil conſequence to the Partners, and all other ſuch Criminals;</hi> becauſe it encourageth them to venture upon and perſiſt in ſuch Courſes as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them more and more in Sin, whereby they treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath; and expoſe them to all thoſe temporal Evils, which uſually firſt or laſt over-take them. Whereas by ſuch a Diſcovery, as I have recommended, the Perſons diſcovered might poſſibly be reclaimed and brought to Repentance, at leaſt might be hindered from ſo much increaſing their Score, which were better for them, though by an unnatural and otherwiſe untimely Death, than
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41069:5"/>that they ſhould longer protract a miſerable Life here to the increaſe of their Miſery hereafter. Nor is it leſs <hi>pernicious to the Malefactor himſelf.</hi> For as without true Repentance no Pardon can be expected with God: So whoever doth not all he can to make Reſtitution, and repair all the Evil and Damage he hath done, and to prevent all he can for the future, can be no true Penitent, holding ſtill an implicit Confederacy at leaſt, with wickedneſs. And as he can expect no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God, ſo is he to be looked upon by Men, not as a Man of Honor in any reſpect, but as a reprobate, deluded, and hardned Wretch, an Enemy to Man-kind, and a Confederate with Death and Hell, and the Kingdom of Darkneſs; an odious and deteſtable Creature, inſtead of being in the leaſt honourable as he vainly fancied. That, which only is Honourable or Commendable in ſuch Caſe, and the only true Wiſdom, is, 1. To conſider ſeriouſly the unreaſonableneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the Crime, till ſuch conſideration hath produced a juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Abhorrence of it. 2. To acknowledge ingenuouſly his own Folly and Impotence to yield to and be overcome by ſuch a Temptation, what-ever it was, which induced him to it; and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more manly to have born any hardſhips of a tranſitory human Life, than ſo baſely to have violated the Order of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which aſſigned thoſe hardſhips for his Exerciſe, and the Laws of his Country. 3. To give Glory to God, acknowledging the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his Puniſhment, and the ſpecial Providence of God, who hath brought him to it not only in Juſtice, but in Mercy too, to cut off his Sin, for Correction of his Miſcarriages, and that he may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the World, if he truly and effectually repent, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed. 4. To endeavour, as far as poſſible he can, to break all ſuch Confederacies, and prevent all the Miſchief which might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be committed by a plain Diſcovery of all he knoweth. This indeed would be an Evidence of ſuch a Change and Diſpoſition of Mind, as is really valuable in the Judgment of all Good and Wiſe Men, and acceptable in the ſight of Almighty God, and therefore truly Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with others, and the trueſt wiſdom for himſelf.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſaid to Criminals is fit to be conſidered by all who have any knowledge of any ſuch Crimes. That which they may fancy to be Faithfulneſs, or Charity, or Pity to Criminals, is a great Miſtake and Deluſion, and in truth Unfaithfulneſs and want of due regard to their Country. That Malefactors be brought to condign Puniſhment both Juſtice and Charity to our Country require; which is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Conſideration of any particular Perſon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hinder, or refuſe ones Aſſiſtance to it, is to prefer a Malefactor, and deſert the Duty he ows his Country. But in other reſpects Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Humanity requires more to be done for them, than uſually is with us.</p>
